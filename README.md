# Medical Imaging with Azure Machine Learning Demos 

Welcome to our medical imaging demo repository! The content includes several Python notebooks that cover medical imaging use cases based on classification, object detection and instance segmentation.

All use cases are based on publicly available datasets like brain RMI scans, cell micrographs, chest x-ray images and more. Since we cannot distribute the data directly, we refer to publicly available download locations.

The purpose of our notebooks is to demonstrate how Azure Machine Learning can be used to support medical imaging and other use cases in areas like data and model management, deployment, experiment tracking and explainability. Furthermore, we cover various data science approaches ranging from manual model development with PyTorch to automated machine learning for images. Another focus is to provide MLOPS based examples for automating the machine learning lifecycle for medical use cases including retraining when new data becomes available.
